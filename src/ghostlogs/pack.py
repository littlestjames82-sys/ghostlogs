"""Incident pack builder: budget selection plus INCIDENT.md and
manifest.json writers.

Emission priority under the budget: timeline anchors (mandatory),
then error windows (highest severity, then file order), then
duplicate exemplars (highest count first).

Budget fit is decided on the rendered pack, not on per-item
estimates alone (those once underestimated the document scaffold
badly enough to ship an over-budget pack while a fittable selection
existed; see FIX_REPORT.md, defect D3). The builder descends a tier
ladder, rendering and measuring each candidate for real:

  full      - windows with all stored lines, plus exemplars
  trimmed   - windows trimmed to matched lines, trace/continuation
              lines, and repeat representatives, plus exemplars
  exemplars - no windows; anchors plus duplicate exemplars
  anchors   - the mandatory minimum only

The first tier whose rendered estimate lands at or under the budget
ships with a clean exit. The over-budget path (pack written, marked
over_budget, exit 1) is reached only when even the anchors tier
cannot fit, i.e. when the mandatory content alone exceeds the
budget, which is the only case the plan reserves it for.

Counts reconcile exactly by construction at every tier and are
re-checked here: total source lines = kept + collapsed + dropped,
and the dropped reasons sum to the dropped total. Anchor lines that
also fall inside a window or a duplicate group are counted once, as
kept; the by-reason arithmetic adjusts for that overlap explicitly.
